# 🎨 CSS UI Experiments

A collection of UI components and layout experiments focused on clean design, responsive behavior, and frontend styling patterns.

These small UI builds showcase your ability to design interfaces using **HTML & CSS**, and they’re great additions to a portfolio or frontend playground.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This repository contains visual experiments exploring:

- Modern CSS layout techniques
- Responsive behavior
- UI component styling
- Design patterns for web interfaces

This is a place where ideas become reusable, visual blocks — a frontend design playground.
